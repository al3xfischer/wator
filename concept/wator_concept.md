# Wa-Tor Simulation
Wa-Tor is a predators and prey population simulation.
The planet on which those species live is shaped like a doughnut or torus.
It's normally realized as a two dimensional grid.
Each cell on that grid can contain a fish, shark or just water.
Time passes in chronons.
All animals move during each chronon and if they trespass the grid borders they reappear on the opposite border.
Sharks must eat fish regularly to survive otherwise they starve.
Fish eat plankton which is assumed to be infinitely available.
Both species breed if certain conditions are met.
